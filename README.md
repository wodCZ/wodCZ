### Hi there üëã, I'm wod!

I'm a software developer, currently based in the city of Budweis, Czechia. I started coding profesionally back in 2010-ish and have developed dozens of projects from scratch to production.

I consider myself a Full-Stack developer. Here's a list of technologies I currently work with:
- [Nest.js](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) for Node.js Back-ends, preferably with [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) ORM.
- [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) for mobile app development.
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for Front-End development. If possible, I go with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), but I don't work on much projects of the scope that would need that nowadays.
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for infrastructure deployment and management.
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) for projects that need to be highly-available, [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/) for simple projects on low budget.

### Hiring

I'm not looking for a job at the moment. If you'd like me to work on your project, get in touch with [ARGO22](https://www.argo22.com?utm_content=wodCZGH&utm_medium=social&utm_source=github.com&utm_campaign=wodcz). I come with the full package of trained professionals ranging from Business Analysis üß†, through UX & UI design üßë‚Äçüé®, Project Management üëÆ to Development üßë‚Äçüíª.

### Writing

I don't blog much, but when I do, you can find it on [my homepage](https://www.ikw.cz). I also have [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Martin_Janecek), but mostly to follow fellow developers.
